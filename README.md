This application is still in development and I was on the contract-based android application where I make quizzes, statistics, overlay windows, and fix some errors in different sections of the app.

Application is for the students which contain questions in a quiz wrapped in a package, also the teacher can create packages with number of questions in its answer and those packages will get converted in the quiz and these packages will be available in the packaging market in the application. There are other useful features in application like a floating window where the user can enable and give answers while he is outside of the application and other features like sharing packages and give a review to packages.

### Technolgies : Android SDK , Kotlin, Xml, Firebase, MVVM

## Some Cool Projects :smile:

### Computer controller
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/check-it-out.svg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10clWduncP0a4BY9wJDU3ncJ9-e4sbteW/view) 

Application is used to control keyboard and mouse in the computer using an android phone, you need to install server application in computer and apk in android, in order to work the application your both devices should be in the same network. You can even play games using a gyro sensor in android.

### Computer vision controller

You can use a single paper to control the game, you just need to show paper in front of camera and move to different directions in order to control the game.
This application is using the OpenCV for performing computer vision algorithms it is used to capture the color and also calculate a distance where the paper is moved and then converting coordinate into a game coordinate and press the buttons for controlling the game.
